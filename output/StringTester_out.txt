Original STRING: I really enjoy this class by Professor DePratti!

REPLACE GLOBALLY BY REGEX:

.replaceAll is basically the s/regex/replace/g (ed) of java

Above, I have called the method to change out the word class, using a simple pattern, with assignment
I then replaced your name using [A-HJ-Z].* which doesn't hit the capital I at the begining but matches your name at the end and replace it with my name
String: I really enjoy this assignment by Anthony DeDominic!

CONCATENATION:

I can also concatenate strings too using .concat() method
String: I really enjoy this class by Professor DePratti! This is another String!

SPLITTING:

using .split() a string can be split by a regular expression into a String[] array.

Each string below was split and fed into a foreach loop and printed on a new line
String: I
String: really
String: enjoy
String: this
String: class
String: by
String: Professor
String: DePratti!

JOINING:

Joining using join allows you to bring a collection of strings and to append them together by a common delimiter, in this case the string "--".
String: I--really--enjoy--this--class--by--Professor--DePratti!
